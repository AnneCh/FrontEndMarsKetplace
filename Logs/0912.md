- Added a function for Moralis Cloud functions in order to delete the NFTs from the database once they have been bought or that a request to delete them has been made.

- the delete function only seems to half-way work. It does correctly delete the NFT from the list of NFTListed, as it reverts with my custom message when I try to delete it twice in a row, but the change is not reflected on the database of Moralis.
  Minting new NFts works, so it's a not a problem of connection with the server, but most probably an issue with the cloud function I wrote for it.
