Alright so I finally recreated the steps necessary to connect Moralis' server to my smart contract:

```

The last line shows that Moralis is constantly checking the `eth_blockNumber`, which means Moralis connected to my local testnet

- need to encode in `.env` the moralis' cli api key and secret, so I don't have to enter them every time I deploy
- need to run again the command to register event listeners

the script `addEventsMoralis.js` is still failing.
