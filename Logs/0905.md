I've tried adding

```
    "moralis:sync": "moralis-admin-cli connect-local-devchain --chain hardhat --moralisSubdomain lkei3yi1kglb.usemoralis.com --frpcPath ./frp/frpc"
```

to my `package.json`as it was the difference I observed between my file and Patrick's. Re-ran `yarn install` after deleting my `node_modules` and `yarn.lock`

It did not change the error showing when I run `node addEventsMoralis.js`, it is still showing `Error: Cannot find module 'moralis/node'`

- upgraded web3uikit + added styled component
- tried removing `"moralis-v1": "^1.5.11"` in `package.json` => threw error

-> now the 5 errors that were showing yesterday at loading the localhost are gone

but I still can't run `node addEventsMoralis.js`

-> Found the issue, on the `addEventsMoralis.js`, I needed to state `const Moralis = require("moralis-v1/node")` instead of (moralis/node)

-> Now the error is different `ParseError: Validation failed. Invalid type for chainId. Expected: string`
-> found where the error was... but now.... :

```
anne@AnneSager:~/HAAAAAAAA/FrontEndMarsKetplace$ node addEventsMoralis.js
Working with 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
working on it...
Something went wrong...
```

Something went wrong
....
but God only knows what.

- tried changing the master key = not the problem

======>>>>> adding frp folder with frpc and frpc.ini, I understand now that it's a step that should have not been skipped and did not only pertain to the V1 but also necessary to V2 <<<<======

=> slowly moving through a series of errors, now at least running `./frpc -c frpc.ini` finally tries to start the connection, but I think the IP address is wrong, the error message is :

```
[W] [service.go:128] login to server failed: dial tcp: lookup wciosc5v5doe.usemoralis.com on 127.0.0.53:53: no such host
dial tcp: lookup wciosc5v5doe.usemoralis.com on 127.0.0.53:53: no such host
```

=> pinging this IP address from my terminal returns `name or server not known`
