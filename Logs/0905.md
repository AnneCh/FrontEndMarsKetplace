I've tried adding

```
    "moralis:sync": "moralis-admin-cli connect-local-devchain --chain hardhat --moralisSubdomain lkei3yi1kglb.usemoralis.com --frpcPath ./frp/frpc"
```

to my `package.json`as it was the difference I observed between my file and Patrick's. Re-ran `yarn install` after deleting my `node_modules` and `yarn.lock`

It did not change the error showing when I run `node addEventsMoralis.js`, it is still showing `Error: Cannot find module 'moralis/node'`

- upgraded web3uikit + added styled component
- tried removing `"moralis-v1": "^1.5.11"` in `package.json` => threw error

-> now the 5 errors that were showing yesterday at loading the localhost are gone

but I still can't run `node addEventsMoralis.js`
