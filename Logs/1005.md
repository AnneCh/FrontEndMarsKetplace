I'm using both folders at once everytime I work on this project and don't know where to log my thoughts! :D

I hence created a new server, replaced all the data necessary to change. It was still not getting my events.

Then I found out that I did not put the correct contract address when creating the syncs, corrected it, and now it does register events, but did not create an Active list and removed from ListedNFT class. I think that's because I changed the name of the classes, I'll got figure it out.
