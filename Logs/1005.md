I'm using both folders at once everytime I work on this project and don't know where to log my thoughts! :D

I hence created a new server, replaced all the data necessary to change. It was still not getting my events.

Then I found out that I did not put the correct contract address when creating the syncs, corrected it, and now it does register events, but did not create an Active list and removed from ListedNFT class. I think that's because I changed the name of the classes, I'll got figure it out.

=> I had the names wrong, now the events are correctly registering
=> the change of pinning service prooved good so far, as the console is showing :
NFTBox.js?3c6a:32 The token uri is: ipfs://bafkreicyl6zlj3nltg7cqgmz462xw5oqgv6qprvuv2yhdewnckadl6h4ku
and the IPFs link is correctly displaying the metadata and image.
=> NFT storage used to pin to IPFs instead of Pinata

=> but the front end is not displaying ...

      console.log(imageURIURL)
      console.log(tokenUriResponse.name)
      console.log(tokenUriResponse.description)
    => those three come back undefined.... I'll have to change the metadata file and see if my syntax is wrong

I've changed the json file and removed the set of [], now it gets the proper data but somehow still does not want to load the image....!!!

```

NFTBox.js?3c6a:41 the image is "ipfs://bafybeibg7mpzkn3szrx2dp37tdudmtqnu2nfogr2pnjz5ewu52kshgxehu"
NFTBox.js?3c6a:42 the name is 'POM1 Token'
NFTBox.js?3c6a:43 the description is 'Get your own Plot On Mars! This one is POM1, the first plot MarsPioneersCorporation ever made available for sale.'

```

note for later, if the events are not synced anymore, check that the contract's address is still correct (has it been reused?), if not, need to re-do the process of sync
