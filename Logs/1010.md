Alright, I'm giving up, there's nothing I can do on my own to understand what's going wrong. I need help.

Here is the plan:

- restart everything
- take screenshots and copy all the error messages
- post on github repo Patrick Collins
- post on Moralis in case they'd know
- move forward to implement functions independent from this problem, as the rest of the information is correctly displaying (price, owner)

=> I will be offline for about 1 month because of a medical trip; if I can work, I'll be working on making the metadata for the other two NFTs and moving forward with the tutorial to implement the rest of the functions.

My DApp was archived and restarting it seems to be taking time, the network window is stuck on `Loading`. I'll do it as soon as I can
