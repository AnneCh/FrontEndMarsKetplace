Alright, I'm giving up, there's nothing I can do on my own to understand what's going wrong. I need help.

Here is the plan:

- restart everything
- take screenshots and copy all the error messages
- post on github repo Patrick Collins
- post on Moralis in case they'd know
- move forward to implement functions independent from this problem, as the rest of the information is correctly displaying (price, owner)

=> I will be offline for about 1 month because of a medical trip; if I can work, I'll be working on making the metadata for the other two NFTs and moving forward with the tutorial to implement the rest of the functions.

My DApp was archived and restarting it seems to be taking time, the network window is stuck on `Loading`. I'll do it as soon as I can

DAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
so, right before starting to write an issue post, I tried on thing that I have not tried yet, which was to replace the <Image/> tag with an <img/> tag.
And now it works....

====> will have to figure out at some point why the <Image/> is not responding as well...

but now, onto some styling of the card and displaying POM2 and POM3 !

=== I'm not sure yet how to display all the NFTs from the different contracts. I'm back to the original issue of minting several NFTs with distinctive addresses on one single contract
=== I'll move forward by copying data according to abi
=== At this point, because I am running out of time to present something working, I will move forward and keep thinking about reusing data and building a reusable component template
