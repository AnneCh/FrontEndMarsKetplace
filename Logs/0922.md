(after creating two more contracts and the functions to deploy them)now for some reason when I run the mint and list script, the server is no longer registering those events, hence the front end is not being updated.
-> the sync is correctly workind and so is the `moralis:cloud` command
-> I've added my wallet address to the addresses to watch, and I can see the 20 transactions that my wallet has made on the localnetwork, but NFT listed or active is being registered
-> there are no logs associated with my requests either
