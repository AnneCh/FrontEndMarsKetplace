Dear Code! weeks fly by and days without significant progress seem to accumulate faster than I can count them.
I came accross a very useful package import error fixing, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFUonWJ-Tb0 and will implement it on my `addEvents.js` which would no work before.

I posted on Moralis' forum about the cancel cloud function not working, but have not had any significant improvment. I'll delete this server and create a new one, and try again.
=> nope, still not creating event listeners through the script.... so the fix for the `require` not working or throwing error with module types, is not fixing the addEvents script

Deleting my server and starting a new one was, in the end, the only way I could make the cloud function for deleting NFTs work. Now both cloud functions are working.
Now, on to adding the buy function and test it out!

The `buyNFT` script is working, as well as the event syncronization.

=> All events are correctly being registered on the Moralis server, the `ActiveNFT` list is being updated as the functions are being called, and the `ActiveNFT` list's data is correctly being rendered on the home page (only data, no physical representation yet).

As everything is running smooth with Moralis, I think it's time to merge this branch with the master one.
