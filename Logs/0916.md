Dear Code! weeks fly by and days without significant progress seem to accumulate faster than I can count them.
I came accross a very useful package import error fixing, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFUonWJ-Tb0 and will implement it on my `addEvents.js` which would no work before.

I posted on Moralis' forum about the cancel cloud function not working, but have not had any significant improvment. I'll delete this server and create a new one, and try again.
=> nope, still not creating event listeners through the script.... so the fix for the `require` not working or throwing error with module types, is not fixing the addEvents script

Deleting my server and starting a new one was, in the end, the only way I could make the cloud function for deleting NFTs work. Now both cloud functions are working.
Now, on to adding the buy function and test it out!

The `buyNFT` script is working, as well as the event syncronization.

=> All events are correctly being registered on the Moralis server, the `ActiveNFT` list is being updated as the functions are being called, and the `ActiveNFT` list's data is correctly being rendered on the home page (only data, no physical representation yet).

As everything is running smooth with Moralis, I think it's time to merge this branch with the master one.

========

Moved on to displaying the NFT on the front end, I modified the `update-frontend` file on the backend in order to accomodate for the abi to be updated as well, as the abi is required to get access to the tokenURI, needed to display the NFTs for sale

Somehow it's not grabbing the URI, as it's not being displayed in the console with `console.log(tokenURI)`
when running the tests, the token uri is differnet and not loading in the browser, but at least there is one.
In the console, trying to log `tokenURI` returns undefined.
so I don't know if there's a problem with the function grabbing the data (calling the `tokenURI` function of the contract), or the contract's code itself.

I've moved forward, but as I thought, there's a problem with IPFs/pinata. things are not loading, despite the code running correctly (or at least it looks correct). The moralis server is rendering what needs to be, except for the image, which can't be retrieved

I'll give it more research tomorrow or later, I need a break from this!
