First log with first commits, working on the front-end of the MarsKetplace project.
I'm using NextJS and Moralis for the framework and server (following directions from https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/nextjs-nft-marketplace-moralis-fcc).

First issue I am running into is the following, when running `yarn dev` to run the development server:

```
wait  - compiling...
error - ./components/Header.js:1:0
Module not found: Can't resolve 'web3uikit'
> 1 | import { ConnectButton } from "web3uikit"
  2 | import Link from "next/link"
  3 |
  4 | export default function Header() {

Import trace for requested module:
./pages/_app.js

```
