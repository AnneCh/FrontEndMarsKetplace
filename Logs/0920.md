Image still not displaying, but it looks like it's only because of a way too high loading time on Pinata's side.

I've improved the display of the overall app

- changed the favicon to a mars picture
- changed the background on all the pages of the App to be the Mars picture
- changed the display of the NFT to be more like cards.
  => still need to figure out transparency issues with TailWind to make it only the bg transparent, as `opacity` acts on the text displayed on top of it...
