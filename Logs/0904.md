I've reached the point where I need to start a Moralis server, but the documentation has evolved since the tutorial that I based my code on was released.

Ill publish another branch to work on implementing the new version of Moralis' server following their documentation only, and skip this part of the tutorial
https://docs.moralis.io/docs/nextjs-dapp

-> Instead of passing the ID and server URL onto the `_app.js`, a function `getServerSideProps(context)` is to be added to the page that will need the data from our the blockchain, allowing to start the Moralis server
