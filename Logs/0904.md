I've reached the point where I need to start a Moralis server, but the documentation has evolved since the tutorial that I based my code on was released.

Ill publish another branch to work on implementing the new version of Moralis' server following their documentation only, and skip this part of the tutorial
https://docs.moralis.io/docs/nextjs-dapp

-> Instead of passing the ID and server URL onto the `_app.js`, a function `getServerSideProps(context)` is to be added to the page that will need the data from our the blockchain, allowing to start the Moralis server
... or maybe not, as I now have an error message about not having a <MoralisProvider>

I'm really not sure it is working, as there are no server documentation on the new verison of Moralis, compared to the V1 documents that explain a totally different procedure.

It does not seem like the server is making any call as I'm not seeing anything displayed on the terminal.

I have a series of errors displaying on the rendered page, about hydration.....

I'll give a try to the script that will actually listen to the events on the moralis server.

For this, I'll also need to create a script on the back-end that will get the new contract's address and send the data to `networkMappings.json` on the front-end (create on the json file)
-> correctly executed, the file now has the chainId and the contract's address!
